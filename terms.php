				<br>•	For security and safety purposes

We may also use your contact information in order to alert you to any relevant security issues or safety concerns of which we are aware.
				<br><br><b>BASIS ON WHICH WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b> 
				<br>Like most businesses we may rely on a range of legal basis in order to ensure that our use your personal data is lawful, including:
				<br>•	Where it is needed to provide you with our products or services, such as:
				<br>o	updating your records, contacting you about the relevant product or service (where appropriate);
				<br>o	sharing your personal data with service providers in order to deliver the relevant product or service;
				<br>o	activities relevant to managing the relevant product or service including any enquiries you may make regarding the product or service, your application to receive the relevant product or service, and the administration and management of accounts;
				<br><br>
			<b>OPTING OUT OF EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</b> 
			<br>Subject to the points below relating to service, security and safety communications you have the right at any time to opt out from receiving email communications from us by either following the instructions to unsubscribe included in any communication which we send to you by email or by adjusting your preferences in your user control panel.
			<br>Please note that we may need, from time to time, to contact you via email in order to highlight important changes to the Website, to our services, our terms of use or this privacy notice or for security or safety purposes. We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data for these purposes (as we cannot provide certain services without having the ability to communicate with you in this way) and so if you do not wish for us to contact you about such matters then you will need to delete your account (please note that you will then be unable to use those features of the Website or services which require you to be a registered user).
			<br><br><b>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</b> 
			<br>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:
				<br>	•	in order to:
				<br>o	enforce or apply the Terms of Use and other agreements or to investigate potential breaches of the same; and/or
				<br>o	protect the rights, property or safety of Patient, our customers, or others;
				<br>•	if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request;
				<br>•	if it is to a third party performing services on our behalf (and who may only use such information to provide services that we have requested and not for any other purpose), for example, third party companies that provide analytical services so that we can better understand our users and so tailor the services that we provide;
				<br>•	in connection with a potential sale or transfer of part or all of our business. In such circumstances we may share information with prospective purchasers (for example as part of a controlled due diligence exercise); and/or
				<br>•	if we reorganise our business as we may need to transfer information about you to another member of our group of companies so that we could continue to provide services to you.
				<br><br>
			<b>	HOW AND WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b>
			<br>The personal data that we collect from you will be processed (which may include, where relevant, storing it) in accordance with our obligations under the relevant laws which set out our obligations as someone that has personal data within our possession and control (typically referred to as a ‘data controller’).
			<br>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to the Website; any transmission that you make is therefore made at your own risk. However, once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent any unauthorized or unlawful access. 
			<br>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Website or services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password information with anyone.
			<br><br><b>ACCESS TO INFORMATION</b> 
			<br>You have the right to access certain information held about you so that you can be aware of, and verify the lawfulness of, the processing we undertake.
			<br><br> <b>Right to have information corrected</b> 
			<br>If you identify that any personal data that we hold about you is wrong, inaccurate or out of date then you may ask us to correct or update it. Please contact us via the details provided below and we will review each request and respond accordingly.
			<br><br> <b>Right of erasure and the right to stop or limit our processing of your personal data</b>
			<br>The right of erasure is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. You have the right to ask us to stop or to erase data we hold about you. Alternatively, you can ask us to limit any processing we are undertaking in respect of your personal data. These rights arise if we no longer have a valid reason to do so or if we have held it for too long.
			<br>These are not absolute rights but every request we receive will be considered carefully and we will respond accordingly (providing grounds for any decision we make).
			<br><br> <b>Right to withdraw consent</b>
			<br>You are free to withdraw any consent which you have given to us in relation to our use of your personal data at any time. Please note that not all uses which we make of your personal data require your consent (for example, if we need to use that information in order to provide a service you have requested then we do not need your consent in order to do so).
			<br><br> <b>Right to object</b>
			<br>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time. This effectively allows you to stop or prevent the processing of your personal data. An objection may be in relation to all of the personal data we hold (as a controller) about you or only to certain information. It may also only relate to a particular purpose we are processing the data for. Save in relation to direct marketing communications (where you have the right to tell us to stop sending you such materials at any time) this is not an absolute right but every request we receive will be considered carefully and we will respond accordingly (providing grounds for any decision we make).
			<br><br> <b>Right to complain</b>
			<br>If you are unhappy about the way in which we have processed your personal data then you have a right to raise the issue or to lodge a complaint with the National Privacy Commission.
			<br><br> <b>Changes to our privacy notice</b>
			<br>	We will keep this privacy notice under regular review and we may update this privacy notice from time to time (for example, to reflect changes we might make to our services or to reflect changes in the law or best practice). Any changes we may make to our privacy notice in the future will be posted on this page. We encourage you to visit this page periodically so that you are aware of any changes which have been made.
			<br><br> <b>This version of the privacy notice is effective as from [06 October 2021].</b>
